# Tadah React
This is the fifth project from my laravel in 10 projects series.

It uses a REST api made with laravel. Original laravel project is [available here](http://tadah.herokuapp.com)

You can preview project [here](http://tadah.netlify.com)

### What Brad Traversy did

- jQuery to make AJAX calls to the API
- Creating tasks and all tasks loads on the same page

### What Aremu Smog did differently
- Used React framework
- Used ES6 fetch api to make calls to the API
- Created a better layout for the app and separated creating tasks and all recent tasks into different pages
